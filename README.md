This is a todo list web application project

It is developed using html, css n javascript for front-end.

nodejs, express.js, mongodb n mongoose for back-end.

You can also create a custom todolist by -->

1. adding a '/' after the website URL and giving any routename of your choice.

2. A nw todo-list gets created with that entered routename.
